#### Hello,
***

***Momorito*** designed to help you do your things stress-free, based on ***GTD: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity*** by David Allen.
At first, Memorito was just my academic project to graduate with a bachelor in The Quchan university of technology . But there wasn't any reason to had fewer features than its similar software.
***
Memorito is built with *C++*, *Javascript*, *PHP*, *QML*, and *the Qt software framework* and made based on the *MVC programming architecture*.
***
This software is available to you both online and offline. Times you don't have access to the internet; Your information will store on your device. Then when you access the internet, It will sync with the Memorito server.
***
You can use Memorito on devices supported by *Linux*, *Windows*, *Mac*, *Android*, *iOS*, and information will be available to you integrated on some devices.
***
We have tried to give you the best possible features. You can adjust each part according to your taste; It's including the theme and the primary color of the app, But you must notice that these settings are specific to the device. You can use the software on other devices with different custom settings.
***
Memorito is made open-source, so You can download the source codes and apply your changes. *Memorito* is available under the GPL license. You must release it under the GPL license if you made your changes and published it. I will be so happy if we add these changes to the app. You can contact us by sending a Pull Request in the GitHub repository or email software's mail at memoritoApp@gmail.com. Additionally, You can give star or fork this project on GitHub.
